# hello-world
Some trials with Git and GitHub + public ideas for future projects !

I am learning how to use GitHub with the official guide https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

I was directed to GitHub from the [Free Code Camp website](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) !

Next job will be to create a test Jupyter notebook.
